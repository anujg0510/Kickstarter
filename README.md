A take on data wrangling and machine learning concepts with the Kickstarter projects dataset available on Kaggle.

The datasets can be accessed online via this URL - https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects

There are two .csv files attached to the project, dated December 2016 and January 2018 respectively. The files present a snapshot of all the Kickstarter projects as on the respective dates. 

The attached notebook endeavours to apply data wrangling, statistical inferences and machine learning concepts to the datasets.
